[ ] Paper
   1. Figure showing structure of interface and planar and macroscopic averages

[ ] Tests
   1. Check coverage of main functions

[ ] Code
 * Cleanup plotting module. The function `plot_active_plane` is limited to only specific planes.

[ ] Tutorials
    * Add tutorial for all main functions (currently missing `plot_variation_along_vector`, `plot_on_site_potential`)
