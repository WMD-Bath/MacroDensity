# TODO's

- [x] Checking function docstrings (e.g. should describe what they do, describe inputs/outputs & include type's of input & output variables) 
- [] Formatting & cleanup of files
    * Remove unused imports (e.g. if package is imported but not used etc)
    * Maybe some reorganization and renaming of input files to make it more user-friendly (alpha_tools.py etc)?
- [] Generate documentation (with `sphinx`)
    * Should include a intro to what the package can do
    * Python API for main functions
    * A good tutorial (as Jupyter Notebook) exemplifying the main functions & workflow
      * The notebook should combine `Markdown` and `Code` cells to explain the workflow, showing the outputs/plots etc
- [] Checking code & docstrings formatting with linters
    * Using the packages `isort`, `black`, `pycodestyle`, `flake8`
- [] Installation
  - [] Enable `pip` install
- [] Write up `JOSS` paper
