# TODO's

1. Checking function docstrings (e.g. should describe what they do, describe inputs/outputs & include type's of input & output variables)
2. Formatting & cleanup of files
    * Remove unused imports (e.g. if package is imported but not used etc)
    * Maybe some reorganization of input files to make more user-friendly (alpha_tools.py etc)?
3. Generate page for documentation 
    * Should include a intro to what the package can do
    * A good tutorial (as Jupyter Notebook) exemplifying the main functions
